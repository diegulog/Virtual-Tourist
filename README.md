# Virtual Tourist
Created for my class project, as part of the Udacity iOS nanograduate program.

This application allows users to save locations associated with their vacation and display images with each location.
The locations are shown as push pins on a map.
Photos are taken from Flickr.

Setting:

1. You need to get your own Flickr API key and add it to the apiKey in Model/Cliente.swift file

```
static let apiKey = "Your API Key Here"
```
